Notes on installing Moonpig:

0. We assume you have already installed App::cpanminus.

    You may prefer to install the following stuff to a local lib
    directory instead of globally; there is quite a lot of it.  To do
    that, first run:

      cpanm local::lib
      eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=path-to-local-lib)

   Subsequent installations will go into the local lib that you have
   specified, for example $HOME/lib/perl .

1. Install Dist::Zilla from CPAN:

	cpanm Dist::Zilla

2. You will need to obtain from github:

    Moonpig::UserAgent

      https://github.com/rjbs/Moonpig-UserAgent

    Stick

      https://github.com/rjbs/stick

    Install each of these using:

      dzil authordeps | cpanm -q
      dzil listdeps | cpanm -q
      dzil install

3. Now do the same for Moonpig:

      dzil authordeps | cpanm -q
      dzil listdeps | cpanm -q
      dzil test
      dzil install
